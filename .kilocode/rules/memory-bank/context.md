# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

Completed the security and performance optimization of the Supabase database for the AI-powered ceramic e-commerce platform, successfully integrated n8n-MCP for enhanced workflow automation capabilities, and added comprehensive Redis Vector Search documentation to the project.

## Recent Changes

- Created comprehensive project description in brief.md
- Initialized product.md with detailed product description
- **Completed security and performance fixes for Supabase database:**
  - Enabled RLS for `mcp_tools` table and created policies.
  - Fixed mutable search paths in functions (`process_feedback`, `vector_search`, `similarity_search`, `rotate_api_key`).
  - Moved `vector` extension to `extensions` schema.
  - Added indexes for unindexed foreign keys in `compatibility` and `product_chunks` tables.
  - Optimized RLS policies for performance by wrapping `auth.<function>()` calls in subqueries.
  - Consolidated duplicate RLS policies in `chat_sessions`, `customer_context`, and `telegram_messages` tables.
  - Removed unused indexes.
- **Successfully integrated n8n-MCP:**
  - Added n8n-MCP configuration to `.kilocode/mcp.json` with comprehensive access to 535+ nodes
  - Configured n8n API integration for workflow management capabilities
  - Updated memory bank documentation to reflect n8n-MCP integration
  - Verified compatibility with existing Supabase and Redis MCP servers
- **Added comprehensive Redis Vector Search documentation:**
  - Enhanced `docs/redis/redis.md` with detailed Redis Vector Search information
  - Created `docs/redis/redis-official-docs.md` with official documentation based on Context7 data
  - Added practical examples, code samples, and integration patterns for AI-powered ceramic product search
  - Documented optimization techniques, performance monitoring, and n8n integration approaches

## Next Steps

1. Verify all memory bank content for accuracy.
2. Document any additional insights or patterns discovered during optimization.
3. Confirm with user that memory bank initialization and optimization are complete and accurate.
4. Test n8n-MCP integration with the existing workflow automation system.
5. Explore advanced n8n-MCP features for AI-powered ceramic product recommendations.
6. Implement Redis Vector Search integration in the actual n8n workflows for ceramic product search.
7. Test the Redis Vector Search functionality with real ceramic product data.
