# Product Description

## Why this project exists

This project exists to create an intelligent e-commerce platform specifically designed for ceramic products that leverages AI to enhance the shopping experience. Traditional e-commerce platforms often struggle with helping customers find the right ceramic products due to the nuanced nature of ceramic items (variations in style, technique, glaze, and artistic intent). This platform addresses these challenges by implementing AI-powered search and consultation capabilities.

## Problems it solves

1. **Complex product discovery**: Ceramic products have subtle variations that are difficult to capture with traditional keyword-based search.
2. **Lack of expert guidance**: Customers often need consultation to find the right ceramic pieces but don't have access to domain experts.
3. **Personalization gap**: Most e-commerce platforms don't effectively personalize recommendations based on user preferences and history.
4. **Inefficient search**: Users struggle to articulate their needs in ways that traditional search engines can understand.

## How it should work

The system operates through two main workflows:

1. **AI Consultant Workflow**: Users can interact with an AI consultant through natural language to get personalized recommendations and answers about ceramic products. The system maintains context throughout the conversation and uses semantic caching to optimize response times.

2. **Product Search Workflow**: Users can search for ceramic products using natural language queries. The system performs hybrid search by combining vector similarity search (for semantic understanding) with database queries (for structured filtering), then reranks results using AI for optimal relevance.

## User experience goals

- **Intuitive discovery**: Users should be able to find relevant ceramic products using natural language descriptions rather than specific keywords.
- **Expert-level guidance**: The AI consultant should provide responses that mimic the knowledge and helpfulness of a ceramic expert.
- **Personalized journey**: The system should learn from user interactions and provide increasingly relevant recommendations over time.
- **Fast responses**: Despite the complexity of AI processing, the system should provide responses quickly through semantic caching.
- **Transparent sourcing**: Users should understand how recommendations are generated and be able to see the sources of information.
